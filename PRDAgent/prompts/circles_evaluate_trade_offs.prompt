Let's EVALUATE TRADE-OFFS by analyzing the pros and cons of different solution options.

Please provide detailed analysis for:

1. **Solution Comparison:**
   - For each major solution option, what are the key advantages and disadvantages?
   - How do solutions compare on important dimensions (cost, time, complexity, risk)?
   - Which solutions best address the highest priority needs?

2. **Technical Trade-offs:**
   - What are the technical complexity implications of each approach?
   - How do solutions compare on performance, scalability, and maintainability?
   - What technical risks or dependencies exist for each option?

3. **Business Trade-offs:**
   - What are the cost implications (development, deployment, maintenance)?
   - How do solutions affect time-to-market and competitive positioning?
   - What revenue or business impact differences exist between options?

4. **User Experience Trade-offs:**
   - How do different solutions affect user experience and adoption?
   - What learning curve or change management is required for each?
   - Which solutions best fit user preferences and workflows?

5. **Strategic Trade-offs:**
   - How do solutions align with long-term product and business strategy?
   - What future flexibility or extensibility do different options provide?
   - How do solutions affect platform or ecosystem considerations?

6. **Risk Assessment:**
   - What are the biggest risks for each solution approach?
   - Which solutions have the highest probability of success?
   - What are the failure modes and mitigation strategies for each?

**Response Format:**
Please create a comparison matrix or detailed analysis showing how each solution scores on key evaluation criteria. Include your reasoning for trade-off assessments.
