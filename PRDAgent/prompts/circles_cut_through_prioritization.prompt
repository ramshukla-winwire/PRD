Now let's CUT THROUGH PRIORITIZATION to focus on what matters most and what to tackle first.

Please provide information about:

1. **Priority Framework:**
   - What criteria will you use to prioritize features/requirements?
   - Consider: Impact vs. Effort, Customer value, Business value, Strategic alignment
   - What is the relative importance of different customer segments?

2. **Must-Have vs. Nice-to-Have:**
   - Which features are absolutely critical for launch (MVP)?
   - Which features can be deferred to later versions?
   - What would make the product unusable if missing?

3. **Resource Constraints:**
   - What are the timeline constraints for launch?
   - What budget or resource limitations exist?
   - What technical constraints affect prioritization?

4. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Which features carry the highest risk (technical, market, business)?
   - Which features are safest to implement first?
   - What assumptions need to be validated early?

5. **Stakeholder Priorities:**
   - What are the different priorities from various stakeholders?
   - How do you resolve conflicts between different priorities?
   - Who has final decision-making authority?

6. **Sequencing Strategy:**
   - What is the logical order for building features?
   - What dependencies exist between features?
   - What makes sense to build and learn from first?

**Response Format:**
Please provide a prioritized list with clear rationale for why certain features/needs rank higher than others. Include timeline implications.
